    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <h2>BBQ Smoking</h2>
            <p>What tastes better than a great piece of smoked meat?? Not much in my opinion! 
                Smoking meat takes time and patience; lessons we should all learn in life.</p>
        <h2>Baking</h2>
            <p>Fresh bread. Cookies. Warm gooey cinnamon rolls. Need I say more?</p>
        <h2>Sports</h2>
            <p>I love sports both watching and playing. It is always a fun time playing slowpitch softball with great friends. 
                My favorite sports include football, softball, baseball, basketball, and every sport during the Olympics.</p>
        <h2>Welding</h2>
            <p>I took up welding because I wanted a utility trailer. I looked at several of them and 
                thought...I bet I could build one just as good or better. So I did. I took a welding class at 
                a local high school, bought the tools, and got to work. It was challenging at times when things
                didn't go as smoothly as planned, but the result turned out great. I have used the trailer on 
                several trips and it is just what I wanted!</p>
